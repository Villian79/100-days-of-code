# 100 Days Of Code - My Logs

*****

### Day 1: December 4, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

- Cleaned up my GitHub profile, deleted few repos. Played with [markdown](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link) a bit. Tried to mentally prepare myself for the challenge. :fire:
- Started learning about AJAX. Completed several basic requests using free APIs.

**Thoughts:** For the long period of time AJAX was a "black hole" for me. Today it started clicking.

### Day 2: December 5, 2017, Tuesday

**Today's Progress**: 

- Learned about testing applications. Got aquainted with [Jasmin](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html). Spend time watching "Advanced Web Developer Bootcamp" by Colt Steele and understanding core concepts of testing.
- Played around with AJAX requests. Getting ready to complete [Random Quote Machine](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine) for [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org)

**Thoughts:** Discovered that testing is quite interesting. Wand to understand it more deeply. Like to find bugs and fix them.

**Links to work:** 
No valuable code created today.

1. Framework documentation: [*Jasmine Framework*](https://jasmine.github.io/index.html)

### Day 3: December 6, 2017, Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

- Intermediate JS functions: forEach(), map(), filter(), some(), every(), reduce()

**Thoughts:** Reviewed my knowledge of JS functions. Practiced some simple exercises. Getting ready to build my first API

**Links to work:** 
Coding using Chrome browser console

**Resources used**
1. [*MDN documentation*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)

*****

### Day 4: December 7, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

- Intermediate JS: closures, keyword "this", call, apply, bind. Learning and solving test problems

**Thoughts:** Did not have much time to work. Spent around two hours after soccer game. Reviewed my knowledge of JS functions. Practiced some simple exercises. Getting ready to build my first API

**Links to work:** 
Coding using Chrome browser console

**Resources used**
1. [*MDN documentation*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)

### Day 5: December 8, 2017, Friday

**Today's Progress**: 

- Intermediate JS: OOP, objects, prototypes, inheritance, etc.

**Thoughts:** Again didn't have as much time to work and learn as I would like to. Yes, learning OOP is kinda fun. But at the same time I mostly follow the tutorials and don't do much coding. Getting ready to build my first API

**Links to work:** 
Coding using Chrome browser console

**Resources used**
1. [*MDN documentation*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web)

### Day 6 - Day 7: December 9-10, 2017, Saturday - Sunday

**Today's Progress**: 

- Coding Along. Created basic ToDo app that uses local API. Reviewed Express, MongoDB, npm. Started learning new features introduced by ES-2015.

**Thoughts:** Coding along is a nice thing to make you feel that you accomplished something. But it's not helpful unless you do your own project and get stuck with those concepts you've already been introduced. False feeling of accomplishment. It's been a long time since I worked on MEAN project. Have to rebuild knowledge. Tomorrow will try to accomplish FCC Random-Quote-Machine challenge. 

**Links to work:**

### Day 8: December 11, 2017, Monday

**Today's Progress**: 

- Learning ES2015. New features: const, let, template strings, arrow functions, default parameters, for...of loops, rest, spread.
- Learning ES2015. New stuff: classes, instance methods, inheritance, super, extends

**Thoughts:** I definitely enjoy working with objects. Wanted to do more, but learning this material takes a lot of time. Feeling tired.

### Day 9-10: December 12-13, 2017, Tuesday - Wednesday

**Today's Progress**: 

- Started Random-Quote-Machine project for FCC. Almost completed. All that left is js logic for the TWITTER button

**Thoughts:** JS stuff was kind of easy. Didn't have too much trouble creating JSONP request to the API. CSS is a mess. I don't know where even start to figure it out. 

**Links to work:** 
Coding using Atom.

### Day 11: December 14, 2017, Thursday

**Today's Progress**: 

- Completed and submitted Random-Quote-Machine project for FCC. 

**Thoughts:** It takes a lot of time to check if everything works correctly even on such a tiny app. Can't imagine how to do it on big projects...
